vggface:
  Siamese neural network for chest x-ray decease classification using an adapted vggface network (available: [TODO]).

autoencoder:
  An autoencoder for chest x-rays of healthy patients and patients affected by COVID-19 and Pneumonia. The hope is to use 
  the encoder with a shallow network to classify patients.
